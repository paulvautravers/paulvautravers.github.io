    <p class="paragraph--main"> I am a recent Master of Physics graduate from the University
        of Manchester, excelling in computational physics projects across C,C++ and Python. I am keen
        to step into graduate technical roles, whether in software engineering, data analysis or mathematical modelling.
        I am always curious to learn new concepts and apply them. For now, I am applying newly acquired skills in html and CSS from 
        codecademy and developing this page! I am updating this page to document my previous computational projects 
        that I have undertaken at University and in internships abroad. In the future, I hope to share new personal 
        projects and write about my developing interests in tech. 
        <br></br>Please reach out if you have any career opportunities, or if you'd just like 
        to collaborate on a project or compete in a hackathon together!

        After exploring the average persistence of cells, using the neural network Hurst analysis and displacement correlation function,
        we developed a toy model of fractional Brownian motion, confined in a cylinder. We felt that the minimum in persistence observed
        for the ensemble average at specific timescales, i.e. downsampling rates, could be due to geometric restraints imposed on the 
        cells. We developed a toy model of individual cells moving within a cylinder, under fractional Brownian motion, using Python.  </p>
